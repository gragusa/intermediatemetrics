## Course descriptions

[{{< var course.name >}} ({{< var course.number >}})]{.coursename}  is a master's-level course that provides students with a rigorous foundation in both theoretical and applied econometric analysis. It covers tools used in modern empirical research in economics, finance, and other social sciences.

**Part I** covers the theoretical foundations of cross-sectional and panel data econometrics, with a focus on asymptotic theory and the potential outcomes framework that underlies causal inference. Building on these fundamentals, we study the classical linear regression model—including estimation, inference, and the challenges that arise when key assumptions fail. We then extend these ideas to instrumental variables and linear panel data models, emphasizing identification, estimation, and inference. Throughout this first part, the focus is primarily on data generated by independent random variables.

**Part II** covers time series econometrics. We begin with ARIMA models, which provide a foundation for understanding stochastic dynamics, persistence, and forecasting. We then turn to Vector Autoregressions (VARs) as a flexible framework for modeling the joint dynamics of multiple time series, followed by Structural VARs (SVARs)—one of empirical macroeconomists' most widely used tools for identifying causal relationships and conducting policy analysis. The course continues with an introduction to state-space models and the estimation of their parameters through the Kalman filter. It concludes by applying these techniques to Dynamic Factor Models (DFMs), which are commonly employed to summarize information from large panels of time series and underpin virtually all contemporary approaches to high-dimensional forecasting and macroeconomic analysis.

## Software and Computing

This course includes hands-on programming work using [Julia](https://julialang.or), a high-performance language well suited to numerical and statistical computing. Through coding exercises and empirical applications, students will implement the techniques presented in lectures—from OLS and instrumental variables estimation to Kalman filtering and dynamic factor models.

Programming is an invaluable way to understand the details of econometric methods: writing code forces clarity about each step of an estimation procedure and reveals how theoretical assumptions translate into practical choices. By building estimators from first principles, students develop a deeper intuition for the techniques and gain experience bridging the gap between theory and application.

Prior experience with [Julia](https://julialang.or) is not required, but familiarity with programming fundamentals (in any language) is helpful. Introductory materials on Julia will be provided at the start of the course.

## Textbooks

The course draws primarily on four textbooks:

1. **Wooldridge, Jeffrey M.** *Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data.* MIT Press, 2010.

2. **Angrist, Joshua D., and Jörn-Steffen Pischke.** *Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion.* Princeton University Press, 2009.

3. **Hamilton, James D.** *Time Series Analysis.* Princeton University Press, 1994.

4. **Brockwell, Peter J. and  Richard A. Davis.** Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, Springer, 2002.

These are advanced references, but selected chapters and sections will be accessible at the level of this course. Where appropriate, supplementary lecture notes will be provided to present the material in a more intuitive and accessible manner.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have a solid background in introductory econometrics at the level covered by standard undergraduate textbooks such as *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* by Jeffrey Wooldridge or *Introduction to Econometrics* by James Stock and Mark Watson.

Successful completion of the **Econometrics** course offered in the *Laurea Triennale in Economics and Finance*—or an equivalent undergraduate course—satisfies this prerequisite.

Students who have not previously taken a formal course in econometrics are **strongly encouraged to review the foundational material** before the start of the semester. Independent study using Wooldridge or Stock and Watson is highly recommended to ensure adequate preparation for the advanced topics covered in this course.
