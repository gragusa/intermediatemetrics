    "text": "Course descriptions\nIntermediate Econometrics (10620843) is a master’s-level course that provides students with a rigorous foundation in both theoretical and applied econometric analysis. It covers tools used in modern empirical research in economics, finance, and other social sciences.\nPart I covers the theoretical foundations of cross-sectional and panel data econometrics, with a focus on asymptotic theory and the potential outcomes framework that underlies causal inference. Building on these fundamentals, we study the classical linear regression model—including estimation, inference, and the challenges that arise when key assumptions fail. We then extend these ideas to instrumental variables and linear panel data models, emphasizing identification, estimation, and inference. Throughout this first part, the focus is primarily on data generated by independent random variables.\nPart II covers time series econometrics. We begin with ARIMA models, which provide a foundation for understanding stochastic dynamics, persistence, and forecasting. We then turn to Vector Autoregressions (VARs) as a flexible framework for modeling the joint dynamics of multiple time series, followed by Structural VARs (SVARs)—one of empirical macroeconomists’ most widely used tools for identifying causal relationships and conducting policy analysis. The course continues with an introduction to state-space models and the estimation of their parameters through the Kalman filter. It concludes by applying these techniques to Dynamic Factor Models (DFMs), which are commonly employed to summarize information from large panels of time series and underpin virtually all contemporary approaches to high-dimensional forecasting and macroeconomic analysis."

    "text": "Software and Computing\nThis course includes hands-on programming work using Julia, a high-performance language well suited to numerical and statistical computing. Through coding exercises and empirical applications, students will implement the techniques presented in lectures—from OLS and instrumental variables estimation to Kalman filtering and dynamic factor models.\nProgramming is an invaluable way to understand the details of econometric methods: writing code forces clarity about each step of an estimation procedure and reveals how theoretical assumptions translate into practical choices. By building estimators from first principles, students develop a deeper intuition for the techniques and gain experience bridging the gap between theory and application.\nPrior experience with Julia is not required, but familiarity with programming fundamentals (in any language) is helpful. Introductory materials on Julia will be provided at the start of the course."

Independent study using Wooldridge or Stock and Watson is highly recommended to ensure adequate preparation for the advanced topics covered in this course."
